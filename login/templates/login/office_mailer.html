<h2 style="font-family: 'Mate SC', serif;">Dear Candidate,</h2>

As you are aware our organization has off late been under social engineering attacks and
our CEO wants us to ensure that everyone has updated their AntiVirus. With regards to that, 
we recently initiated the rollout of a new version of Antivirus to all computers. 

Thanks for your support in driving the initiative successfully.

As the next steps, we are required to regularly check and upgrade the 
software and AV definitions.
