<h3>Hi User,</h3>

Iâ€™m writing to send instructions on how to set up FileVault 2 in your computer. 
Please follow these steps and let me know if you have any questions.

Create a recovery/backup of your data to avoid any risk of data loss:

Prepare an external hard drive to store the backup. To backup your files, 
you can us Time Machine or an OS X Server from your network.

Please note that the first backup may take some time

When configuring FileVault, you can choose between two options:

Allow my iCloud to unlock my disk
Create a recovery key and do not use my iCloud account
If you can keep your recovery key in a USB stick that you can keep in a safe place 
and not share with anyone else, the second option is safer.

Please keep in mind that full- disk encryption is only effective when the 
computer is powered off.
